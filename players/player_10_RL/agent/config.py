"""
Configuration constants and hyperparameters for Player10.

This module contains all the tunable parameters for the lean-cut agent proposal,
with optimized defaults based on Monte Carlo simulation results:
- Altruism=0.5, Tau=0.10, Fresh=0.05, Mono=0.05
- Achieves Total Score: 109.50 ± 7.08, Player10 Score: 2.76 ± 0.14
