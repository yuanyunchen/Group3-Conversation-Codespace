	Calculate monotony score for an item.

	Penalizes items that would continue a subject streak.

	OLD VERSION (INCORRECT):
		- Shadowed the candidate variable name by reusing `item` in a list
			comprehension/loop, making the condition effectively tautological:
			any(s in item.subjects for s in item.subjects)
			This always evaluates True when `item.subjects` is non-empty.
		- Did not explicitly ensure we were checking the last three non-pause
			items, which can under/over-count around pauses.

		Reference (commented out for posterity):
			# if turn_idx < MONOTONY_WINDOW:
			#     return 0.0
			# last_items = [history[j] for j in range(turn_idx - MONOTONY_WINDOW, turn_idx)]
			# if all(
			#     item is not None and any(s in item.subjects for s in item.subjects)
			#     for item in last_items
			# ):
			#     return 1.0
			# return 0.0

	CORRECT APPROACH (this implementation):
		- Look back over the last MONOTONY_WINDOW non-pause items.
		- Apply the spec: if ANY subject of the candidate appears in EACH of the
			last three non-pause items, return 1.0 (penalty). Otherwise 0.0.
